Perform Zero-shot decoding.

In zero-shot learning, the goal is to learn a classifier f : X → Y that must
predict novel values of Y that were omitted from the training set. To achieve
this, we define the notion of a semantic output code classifier (SOC) which
utilizes a knowledge base of semantic properties of Y to extrapolate to novel
classes.

In other words:
Given a semantic encoding of a large set of concept classes, can we build a
classifier to recognize classes that were omitted from the training set?

    Zero-shot learning refers to a specific way to evaluate a model. Given two

    example to the right label. Note that this is a binary choice: when
    example 1 belongs to label 1, example 2 necessarily belongs to label 2;
    or vice versa.

    This function trains and evaluates a given model (which defaults to
    linear ridge regression) on each possible pair of samples, using a
    leave-two-out cross validation scheme.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : 2D array (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to perform learning on.
    y : 2D array (n_samples, n_targets)

    verbose : bool

    break_after : int | None
        Break after this many pairwise comparisons. Useful for debugging.
        Defaults to None, which means all comparisons will be performed.
    normalize : bool
        Whether to normalize X and y (normalize along each column).
        Defaults to True (you normally always want to do this).
    model : scikit-learn regression model | None
        The model to use. If None, the RidgeGCV model, given in ridge.py
        will be used. You can also pass a scikit-learn pipeline
        here, which is useful if you want to add some preprocessing steps that
        should be done at each iteration of the leave-two-out loop.
    metric : str
        The distance metric to use. Any distance implemented in SciPy's
        spatial.distance module is supported. See the docstring of
        scipy.spatial.distance.pdict for the exhaustive list of possitble
        metrics. Here are some of the more useful ones:
        'euclidean' - Euclidean distance
        'sqeuclidean' - Squared euclidean distance (the default)
        'correlation' - Pearson correlation
        'cosine' - Cosine similarity

    Returns
    -------
    pairwise_accuracies : 2D array of bool (n_examples, n_examples)
        Matrix containing the results for all pairwise comparisons.
        To tell whether, given 2 examples, the model could correctly tell which
        was which, you can perform a lookup in this matrix:
        pairwise_accuracies[word1_index, word2_index]
        (where word1_index < word2_index)
    model : a scikit-learn regression model
        The model trained on all samples. This is the same model as specied
        in the `model` input parameter. You can use this object to obtain the
        regression weights and such.
    target_scores : 1D array (n_targets,)
        For each target, a score between 0 and 1 of how well it could be
        predicted from the data.
    predicted_y : 2D array (n_items, n_ginter_features)
        The predicted targets using a model trained on all samples.
    patterns : 2D array (n_samples, n_features)
        Activity patterns that can be interpreted.

    Notes
    -----
     - Currently, each sample must belong to a unique label.
     - The zero-shot-learning approach works best when labels have multiple
       targets (i.e. y has multiple columns).
